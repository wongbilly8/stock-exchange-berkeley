    Although FB's revenue pails in comparison to MSFT's revenue, the enterprise values of the two companies are very similar. This is largely due to the fact that FB is a growth company, or a company that is able to generate positive cash flows or earnings in a very short amount of time. For 2015, 2014, and 2013, the company's Y/Y Revenue was 44%, 58% and 55% respectively. In Q216, FB reached 1.13 Billion Daily Active Users WorldWide, and $22.78 Average Revenue per User. FB has not yet witnessed a drop in Revenue Growth.

    Lately, IBM has made numerous aquisitons of companies that are cloud-based such as Gravitant (cloud management), Cleversafe (cloud brokerage and storage), Optevia (SaaS, cloud-based CRM), and Truven Health Analytics (cloud-based healthcare data). This suggests that their business is going to move from consulting to software.
