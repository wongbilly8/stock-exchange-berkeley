                The apple tree (Malus domestica) is a deciduous tree in the rose family best known for its sweet, pomaceous fruit, the apple. It is cultivated worldwide as a fruit tree, and is the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian traditions.
                Apple trees are large if grown from seed, but small if grafted onto roots (rootstock). There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples, resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw and cider production. Apples are generally propagated by grafting, although wild apples grow readily from seed. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Botanical information</strong>
                <br>
                The apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing 1.8 to 4.6 m (6 to 15 ft) tall in cultivation and up to 39 ft (12 m) in the wild.[4] When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by rootstock selection and trimming method. The leaves are alternately arranged dark green-colored simple ovals with serrated margins and slightly downy undersides.[5]
                <br>
                Blossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves, and are produced on spurs and some long shoots. The 3 to 4 cm (1.2 to 1.6 in) flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five petaled, with an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 4–6 flowers. The central flower of the inflorescence is called the "king bloom"; it opens first, and can develop a larger fruit.[5][6]
                <br>
                The fruit matures in late summer or autumn, and varieties exist with a wide range of sizes. Commercial growers aim to produce an apple that is 7.0 to 8.3 cm (2.75 to 3.25 in) in diameter, due to market preference. Some consumers, especially those in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while apples below 5.7 cm (2.25 in) are generally used for making juice and have little fresh market value. The skin of ripe apples is generally red, yellow, green, pink, or russetted although many bi- or tri-colored varieties may be found.[7] The skin may also be wholly or partly russeted i.e. rough and brown. The skin is covered in a protective layer of epicuticular wax,[8] The flesh is generally pale yellowish-white,[7] though pink or yellow flesh is also known.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Wild ancestors</strong>
                <br>
                The original wild ancestor of Malus domestica was Malus sieversii, found growing wild in the mountains of Central Asia in southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Xinjiang, China.[5][9] Cultivation of the species, most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed over a long period of time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted in current populations of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more morphologically similar progenitor Malus sieversii. In strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter predominates.[10][11][12]

                Valeant grew quickly with a series of mergers and acquisitions under the leadership of J.

Valeant acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals for $15.6 billion in 2015. Valeant tried to acquire Cephalon and merge with Allergan, but failed in these efforts.

The company's stock price plummeted nearly 90 percent since the peak. Valeant reversed the price hikes and ended cooperation with specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services and began cooperation with Walgreens.
                <br>
                Valeant is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Beginning May 2016 Joseph C. Papa leads the company. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square fund has a major stake in the company.

 Wells Fargo & Company is an American international banking and financial services holding company headquartered in San Francisco, California, with "hubquarters" throughout the country.[5] It is the third largest bank in the U.S. by assets and the world's largest bank by market capitalization.[6] In July 2015, Wells Fargo became the world's largest bank by market capitalization, edging past ICBC.[6] Wells Fargo surpassed Citigroup Inc. to become the third-largest U.S. bank by assets at the end of 2015. Wells Fargo is the second largest bank in deposits, home mortgage servicing, and debit cards.
 <br>
In 2015, Wells Fargo ranked 10th on the Forbes Magazine Global 2000 list of largest public companies in the world [7] and ranked 30th on the Forbes 500 list of largest companies in the United States, according to Fortune 500 (2015).[8] In 2015, the company was ranked the 22nd most admired company in the world, and the 7th most respected company in the world.[7]
<br>
As of October 2015, the company had a credit rating of AA-.[9] However, for a brief period in 2007, the company was the only AAA-rated bank.[10]
<br>
The firm's primary U.S. operating subsidiary is national bank Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., which designates its main office as Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
<br>
Wells Fargo in its present form is a result of a merger between San Francisco–based Wells Fargo & Company and Minneapolis-based Norwest Corporation in 1998 and the subsequent 2008 acquisition of Charlotte-based Wachovia. Following the mergers, the company transferred its headquarters to Wells Fargo's headquarters in San Francisco and merged its operating subsidiary with Wells Fargo's operating subsidiary in Sioux Falls.
<br>
Along with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup, Wells Fargo is one of the "Big Four Banks" of the United States.[11]
As of December 31, 2015, it had 8,700 retail branches and 13,000 automated teller machines.[7]
The company operates across 35 countries and has over 70 million customers globally.[7]
In February 2014, Wells Fargo was named the world's most valuable bank brand for the second year running[12] in The Banker and Brand Finance study of the top 500 banking brands.[13]
<br><br>
<strong>Community banking</strong>
<br>
The Community Banking segment includes Regional Banking, Diversified Products and the Consumer Deposits groups, as well as Wells Fargo Customer Connection (formerly Wells Fargo Phone Bank, Wachovia Direct Access, the National Business Banking Center and Credit Card Customer Service).
<br>
Wells Fargo also has around 2,000 stand alone mortgage branches throughout the country.
There are many mini-branches located inside of other buildings, which are almost exclusively grocery stores, that usually contain ATMs, basic teller services, and, space permitting, an office for private meetings with customers.[14]
<br>
<strong>Consumer Lending[edit]</strong>
<br>
Wells Fargo Home Mortgage is the largest retail mortgage lender in the United States, as of Q3 2011, originating one out of every four home loans.[15] Wells Fargo services $1.8 trillion in home mortgages, the 2nd largest servicing portfolio in the U.S.[16] It was reported in 2012 Wells Fargo reached 30% market share for US mortgages, however, CEO John Stumpf has said the numbers are misleading because about half of that share represented the aggregation of smaller loans that were then sold on in the secondary market. Now, in 2013 its share is closer to 22%; of which eight percentage points is aggregation.[17]
<br>
Wells Fargo private student loans[edit]
